### Overview

The Reports tab is your gateway to producing insights into the collective status of your container image environment based on the back-end Enterprise Reporting Service.

**Note:** Because the reporting data cycle is configurable, the results shown in this view may not precisely reflect actual analysis output at any given time.

For more information on how to modify this cycle or the Reporting Service in general, please refer to the [Reporting Service]({{< ref "/docs/overview/reports" >}}) documentation.

### Report Manager vs. Quick Report

The Report Manager view provides the tools to create custom queries, set a report to run on a schedule (or store the configuration for future use), and get notified when they're executed in order to receive the insights you're interested in for account-wide artifacts.

Use the Quick Report view to generate a preconfigured Anchore report for immediate viewing or download on-demand.
