### Overview

Added in Anchore Enterprise v2.0

Anchore Enterprise Reports is a new service introduced in v2.0. It aggregates data from Anchore Engine to provide analytics for account-wide resources (such as tags, images and artifacts), and computes pre-defined metrics over the aggregated data. The service exposes a rich GraphQL API for querying and metrics generated by the service

> Note: NOT real time data - expand

### How it works

One of the main functions of Anchore Enterprise Reports is aggregating data from Anchore Engine. As of this release, this service keeps a summary of all current and historical images and tags for every account known to Anchore Engine. The service also maintains vulnerability reports and policy evaluations generated using the active bundle for all the images and tags respectively. 

> Warning: Warn about provisioning storage for persistence. Reports service shares the persistence layer with Anchore Engine.

#### Data ingress

Reports service handles data ingress from Anchore Engine via asynchronous processes that trigger periodically

- **Loader** Compares the working set of images and tags in Anchore Engine with the Reports service. Based on the difference, images and tags along with the vulnerability report and policy evaluations are loaded into the Reports service. Resources deleted from Anchore Engine are marked inactive in the Reports service if they exist. 
- **Refresher** As the name indicates refreshes the vulnerability report and policy evaluations of all the images and tags maintained by the Reports service

> Warning: Warn about the possibility of reports service missing updates to resources such as addition and deletion of tags or changes to active policy bundle in between consecutive ingress processes
