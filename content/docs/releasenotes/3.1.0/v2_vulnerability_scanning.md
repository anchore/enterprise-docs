## Tech Preview: V2 Vulnerability Scanner

A new vulnerability scanning engine, based on [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) improves performance, reduces 
database load, and provides better vulnerability matching results. It includes a new vulnerability feed sync process 
integrated into the enterprise feed service that also provides faster feed syncs from the feed service to the policy engine.

### Tech Preview Conditions and Limitations

1. The new mode must be set at deployment time, the scanner is configured at service startup.
2. Switching modes in a deployment is not supported and may result in data inconsistency.
3. Some features of the policy system are not yet supported in this mode:
  1. `vulnerability` gate triggers not supported for the new scanner. They will return incorrect results when used.
     1. `vulnerability_data_unavailable`
     1. `stale_feed_data policy`
4. Windows container scanning is not yet supported. Support will be added in the next feature release.
5. Proprietary vulnerability feeds are not yet supported in this scanner. Support will be added in the next feature release.

### Feed Syncs

The new vulnerability provider, when configured for use, will sync feeds from the on-premises feed service but will expect
a different format for the feeds data. This format is consistent with the Grype DB, but is built using the data from your
deployed feed service. In future releases, the Microsoft MSRC and VulnDB data soures will be supported as well
