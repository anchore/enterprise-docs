## Anchore Enterprise 2.0.0

Building on top of the existing Anchore Enterprise 1,2 release, Anchore Enterprise version 2.0 adds major new features and architectural updates.  The overarching purpose of the new features and design of the 2.0 version of Anchore Enterprise is to directly address the challenges of continued growth and scale by extending the enterprise integration capabilities of Anchore, establishing an architecture that grows alongside our users’ demanding throughput and scale requirements, and offering even more insight into users’ container image environments through rich new APIs and reporting capabilities, all in addition to the rich set of enforcement capabilities included with Anchore Enterprise’s flexible policy engine.

### New Features

* **GUI Dashboard:** new configurable landing page for users of the Enterprise UI, presenting complex information summaries and metrics time series for deep insight into the collective status of your container image environment.

* **Enterprise Reporting Service:** entirely new service that runs alongside existing Anchore Enterprise services that exposes the full corpus of container image information available to Anchore Engine via a flexible GraphQL interface

* **LDAP Integration:** Anchore Enterprise can now be configured to integrate with your organization’s LDAP/AD identity management system, with flexible mappings of LDAP information to Anchore Enterprise’s RBAC account and user subsystem.

* **Red Hat Universal Base Image:** all Anchore Enterprise container images have been re-platformed atop the recently announced Red Hat Universal Base Image, bringing more enterprise-grade software and support options to users deploying Anchore Enterprise in Red Hat environments.

* **Anchore Engine v0.4:** Anchore Enterprise is built on top of the OSS Anchore Engine, which has received many new features and updates as well.  See [Anchore Engine Release Notes](https://engine.anchore.io/docs/releasenotes/040/) for information on new features, bug fixes, and improvements in Anchore Engine

### Upgrading from Anchore Enterprise 1.2

If using the trial docker-compose method, or the production Helm chart method of deploying Anchore Enterprise, upgrading from 1.2 to 2.0 follows the normal upgrade procedure for Anchore Enterprise.  However, if you are deploying Anchore Enterprise manually or using another orchestration environment, there are new dependencies and considerations to take into account for deploying Enterprise 2.0.  Please visit the upgrade section for more information.
