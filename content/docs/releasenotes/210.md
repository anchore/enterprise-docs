## Anchore Enterprise 2.1.0

Building upon the Anchore Enterprise 2.0 release, Anchore Enterprise 2.1 adds major new features and architectural updates that extend integration / deployment options, security insights, and the evaluation power available to all users.


### New Features

* **GUI report enhancements:** Leveraging Anchore Enterpriseâ€™s reporting service, there is a new set of configurable queries available within the Enterprise GUI Reports control. Users can now generate filtered reports (tabular HTML, JSON, or CSV) that contain image, security, and policy evaluation status for collections of images.

* **Single-Sign-On (SSO):** Integration support for common SSO providers such as Okta, Keycloak, and other Enterprise IDP systems, in order to simplify, secure, and better control aspects of user management within Anchore Enterprise

* **Enhanced authentication methods:** SAML / token-based authentication for API and other client integrations

* **Enhanced vulnerability data:** Inclusion of third party vulnerability data feeds from Risk Based Security (VulnDB) for increased fidelity, accuracy, and live-ness of image vulnerability scanning results, available for all existing and new images analyzed by Anchore Enterprise

* **Policy Hub GUI:** View, list and import pre-made security, compliance and best-practices policies hosted on the open and publicly available Anchore Policy Hub

* **Built on Anchore Engine v0.5:** Anchore Enterprise is built on top of the OSS Anchore Engine, which has received new features and updates as well See [Anchore Engine Release Notes]({{< ref "/docs/engine/releasenotes" >}}) for information on new features, bug fixes, and improvements in Anchore Engine
